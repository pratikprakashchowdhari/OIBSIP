Title: Oasis Infobyte Internship - Task 1 Achievements üåê

Iris Flower Classification, Unemployment Analysis and Car Price Prediction üöÄ

This repository is a testament to the successful completion of Tasks within the 
Oasis Infobyte Internship program, encompassing three distinct projects: 
Iris Flower Classification, Unemployment Analysis in India during COVID, and Car Price Prediction. 
Each task required the implementation of machine learning models to address unique challenges.

Iris Flower Classification: üå∫
The Iris Flower Classification project involved the development of a machine learning model 
to categorize iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
The repository showcases a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, meticulous preprocessing, 
model selection, and performance evaluation through key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Unemployment Analysis in India during COVID: üìâ
In response to the socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Unemployment Analysis project delves into
 the examination of unemployment trends in India. Leveraging data analytics and visualization, 
this task aimed to discern patterns and insights related to joblessness during the challenging period of the pandemic. 
The repository encapsulates data exploration, trend analysis, and visualization techniques.

Car Price Prediction: üöó
The Car Price Prediction project addresses the dynamic field of predictive modeling for car prices. 
By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the model learns from features such as car specifications, brand, and 
market trends to predict accurate price estimates. 
The repository includes thorough data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to ensure the predictive power of the developed model.
